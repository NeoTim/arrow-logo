<p>arrow-logo is an implementation of the Logo programming language.
Logo was designed in 1967 as a system for using computers in education. The motivation was
not to teach children how to program; it was rather to provide a technology-assisted medium for
learning.

<p>In today's world, computing is ubiquitous and the ability to program (write code, build software) a
skill in high demand. Yet, there is no accepted standard curriculum that would teach the basics of the
art and science of programming. Logo provides a possible answer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> Wikipedia entry has much background about the history of Logo.

<li>The Dutch page 
<a href="http://www.nostalgia8.nl/drlogo.htm">http://www.nostalgia8.nl/drlogo.htm</a> is a great collection of Dr. Logo resources</li>

<li>"Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas" is a book by Seymour Papert that
          explains the constructionist philosophy behind Logo programming language. The connection
          to the popular LEGO Mindstorms is not by coincidence. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)">Constructionism</a> wikipedia entry.

<li><a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/">Brian Harvey's homepage</a> has many
            resources on Logo programming, including full text of various books that teach programming
            using the Logo language.

<li><a href="http://www.abz.inf.ethz.ch/">ABZ</a> (homepage in German) is a associated with ETH Zurich is promoting
             the use of Logo to teach computer science concepts in elementary (primary) school as
             well as early secondary school.
